# Benchmarks

The baseline record. Every entry carries the full methodology block as
emitted by the harness (`bench/bench_lz4`, `--gpu` for the device path) — a
number without its methodology cannot be produced, by construction.
Regressions against the recorded baselines block merges unless explicitly
justified ([MASTERPLAN](MASTERPLAN.md) section 5). Corpora are fetched
hash-pinned via `bench/get-corpora.sh` and never committed.

## M1: first GPU decode (Silesia)

The first GPU decode numbers, recorded 2026-07-17 inside the digest-pinned
dev container (`nvidia/cuda:12.6.2-devel-ubuntu24.04`) on the RTX 3080
(sm_86, ~760 GB/s output-bandwidth ceiling). The GPU rows are
device-resident (data already on the GPU; H2D/D2H excluded), CUDA-event
timed. GPU timing jitters ~1–2% run to run.

### Decision rule (masterplan section 9): the decomposition question, settled

The minimal-correct kernel decodes Silesia at **~18 GB/s** (~5x the
single-thread CPU baseline); the **parse-only ceiling is ~35 GB/s** (~10x
CPU), so the redundant lockstep parse costs roughly half the wall time and
the copies the other half (the per-byte 64-bit modulo in the closed-form
gather is the prime suspect).

The parse-only number ceilings **both** single-pass and any two-phase
design (a two-phase phase-1 runs the identical serial parse, so it cannot
exceed ~35 GB/s either). Two-phase's only lever is a faster phase-2 copy —
but single-pass's copy is equally optimizable, and doing so needs no table,
no barrier, and no extra memory traffic. **The decomposition question is
therefore settled for single-pass.** Perf pass 1 (#16) then measured the
two designed copy/parse micro-optimizations; both were rejected on hardware
(see "Perf pass 1" below), and the falsification trigger is evaluated there.

Occupancy readout (issue #14): 46 registers/thread, so ≥ 32 warps/SM is
achievable on sm_86.

### Perf pass 1 (issue #16): the designed micro-optimizations do not help

Both optimizations the #6 design panel grafted for perf pass 1 were
implemented and measured on Silesia against the ~18 GB/s baseline; **both
were rejected by measurement** (masterplan rule: accepted only on recorded
improvement):

| Attempt                                        | Result          | Why                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incremental-mod match gather                   | ~15 GB/s (−16%) | the loop-carried `r += step` dependency pipelines worse than the independent per-iteration `i % offset`, which the compiler overlaps |
| Vectorized (16-byte) literal copy              | ~17 GB/s (−6%)  | Silesia's literal runs are mostly < 16 bytes, so the wide path rarely triggers and only adds setup/branch overhead                   |
| `__syncwarp` elision on zero-literal sequences | neutral         | the barriers are not the bottleneck                                                                                                  |

The empirical conclusion: the minimal-correct byte-per-lane kernel is at a
local optimum for this workload. The bottleneck is **structural** — the
redundant 32-lane parse sets the ~34 GB/s ceiling, and the copies are
latency-bound on the short literal/match runs typical of real data, where
neither a cheaper modulo nor wider copies help. Meaningful gains require
raising the parse ceiling itself (higher occupancy via register reduction,
or warp-specialization), which is larger than a micro-op pass — tracked as
a follow-up (issue #21).

**Falsification-trigger verdict (masterplan section 9).** The shipped
kernel is ~5× CPU (below the ~15× reopen threshold), but two-phase stays
**ruled out**: the parse-only ceiling (~10× CPU) bounds any two-phase
phase-1, which shares the identical serial parse, so two-phase cannot reach
~15× either. The trigger's numeric condition is met while its purpose — does
two-phase help? — is answered NO by the arithmetic. The path to higher
throughput is structural single-pass work, not a decomposition change.

## Baseline: CPU oracle (M0, pre-kernel)

The reference the GPU decoder is measured against: the single-threaded CPU
oracle on the development machine, recorded 2026-07-17.
